Support (some) data conversion between `rdflib` and `pyld` Python libraries.

The [`rdflib`](http://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidocs/) and [`PyLD`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/pyld) libraries use different in-memory data structures so it is not trivial to use the powerful RDF support of rdflib in conjuction with the JSON-LD processor implementation of PyLD. This code is designed to provide a bridge between rdflib and PyLD in-memory formats, avoiding the need to serialize and then re-parse the data.

Limitations
-----------

This code was developed to support a particular application and then pulled out as I needed it a second time. I haven't thought hard about the general case and am sure that are additional limitations beyond those I know about. Known limitations:

  * assumes the `URIRefs` in an `rdflib` graph do not need expansion with a `NamespaceManager`

Contributing
------------

I'd be happy to hear of other problems/limitations and/or suggestions for improvement.
